### What I learned

I learnt more about the picture tag ,when "srcset" can be used and when it can be used. Picture tag can act as a parent for multiple images but when using srcsets, it renders only one image at a certain media query. An image which basically replaces the src property of the image element in the picture tag. instead of using multiple srcsets, in that case you should use multiple image tags and manipulate them with css.

I also learnt how to use (.closest) method to look up the dom tree for a parent
